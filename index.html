                                <p>Since childhood, I have shown a keen interest in computers, mathematics, and logic. However, I encountered some difficulties with math during my late primary school years, which led me to devote countless hours to playing games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, Paladins, and Fortnite. 
                                </p>
                                <p>This pattern persisted during my initial year in high school, but eventually, I renewed my interest in mathematics. I also embarked on a journey of exploring the world through the <span class="erazmus"> Erasmus+ programme</span> and I began studying web development. My initial projects were rather modest, focusing on basic HTML and CSS. In the last year, I got my hopes up and decided to do my final exam in informatics and maths. 
                                </p>
                                <p>I still recall coding in the good old Sublime Text. After a few months, I <span class="opportunity">seized the opportunity</span> to work on my first paid projects in WordPress, which was an entirely different experience. My interest soon evolved into a deep passion, and later on, I worked as a junior web developer / technical support for an American company based in Slovakia.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                           
                            <div class="about-right-text-right">
                                <p>Following nearly two and a half years of travel and freelance work, I made a life-altering decision to move to <span class="denmark">Denmark</span> in pursuit of better life prospects and job opportunities in Scandinavia.
                                </p>
                                <p>Throughout my life, I thought of myself as a dynamic and power-seeking individual - found on the red spectrum. However, in school, I discovered that I fall within the <span class="spectrum">yellow spectrum</span>, characterized as outgoing and spontaneous.  In retrospect it makes sense, however, sometimes I still find it challenging to believe and incorporate it into my field of studies.
                                </p>
                                <p>At present, I am diligently working on organizing my life and dedicating considerable time to my health, studies, and career. My foremost challenge is creating a well-balanced schedule and mastering the Danish language. For my 22nd birthday, I gave myself an extravagant present - after watching a stand-up comedy online for a long time started a career as a standup comedian career in a club in Aarhus, Denmark - Albert's bar.
